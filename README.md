# 🧠 Customer Segmentation using K-Means
This repository contains a project focused on customer segmentation using the K-Means Clustering algorithm. The goal is to identify different groups of customers based on their behavior and spending patterns, helping businesses tailor their marketing strategies.

# 📊 Dataset Description

-CustomerID: Unique ID for each customer
-Gender: Male or Female
-Age: Age of the customer
-Annual Income (k$): Customers’ yearly income
-Spending Score (1–100): Score assigned by the mall based on customer behavior and spending

# 🛠️ Technologies Used

-Python
-NumPy
-Pandas
-Matplotlib
-Seaborn
-Scikit-learn
-Jupyter Notebook

# 📌 Steps Covered in the Notebook

-Importing Libraries
-Loading the Dataset
-Data Preprocessing
-Visualizing the Data
-Finding the Optimal Number of Clusters (Elbow Method)
-Applying K-Means Clustering
-Visualizing the Clusters
-Analyzing the Results

# 📷 Output Visualizations

-The notebook contains:
-Pairplots
-Cluster scatter plots
-Elbow method graph
-Heatmaps (if applicable)
These visualizations help to understand the distribution and characteristics of each cluster.
